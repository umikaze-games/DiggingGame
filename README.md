# DiggingGame â€“ 2D Terrain Editing Tool

## Overview

DiggingGame is a Unity-based 2D terrain editing and digging tool. It enables real-time modification of terrain height and shape via mouse input, with smooth mesh generation powered by the Marching Squares algorithm. This project is ideal for learning about procedural terrain generation and custom editor tool development in Unity.

## Main Features

- **Real-time Terrain Editing:** Edit terrain height and shape interactively with the mouse.
- **Marching Squares Algorithm:** Automatically generates smooth mesh for any terrain shape.
- **Terrain Reset and Visualization:** Instantly reset or visualize the current terrain state.
- **Highly Extensible:** Easily add new terrain effects or interactive features.

## Technical Highlights

- **Optimized Input Management:** Responsive and intuitive user input handling.
- **Dynamic Grid Updates & Normal Interpolation:** Efficiently manages terrain grid data and smooths surface normals.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Clean, maintainable, and easy to extend.

## Requirements

- Unity 6000.0.24f1 or higher (recommended)
- PC environment
